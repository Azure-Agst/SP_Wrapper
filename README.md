# SwitchPresence Wrapper

legit just a c# project to call two apps and kill one when the other exits

i could have done this in batch but then i wouldnt have a fancy icon to put on my desktop and it would ruin my aesthetic :(

anyways, compiled release here: [releases](https://github.com/Azure-Agst/SP_Wrapper/releases)
